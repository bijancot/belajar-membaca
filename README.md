# Hi, welcome this is panji

More about me here. So i've been work as devops engineer for almost 2+ years in [SIRCLO](https://www.sirclo.com/). I work with many people and tools, i assume you guys will be interested to the tools part but let me talk more about my self. So beside woek as a devops i also have interest in teaching and researching, that's why in the mean time i also attend a class as a lecturer and that's very fun. 

I make this blog because i belive with my articles (even though i'am not sure it will always good) i can continue share my knowledge, new things without hesitate. I also love to try some new tools research about some issue and make a tools to fix it that's why i learn programming again in december 2023. 

So nice to meet you, if you have something to talk about like super serious things or maybe just discussion about certain meme, just slide to my social media. Cheers 

And there is my skillset :
Docker, Docekr Compose also, kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Teraform (i just started to learn about open tofu so rebel inside), Helm, Helmfile, Traefik, Git, Girhub Action CICD, Gitlab Runner, Grafana, Victoria Metrics, Prometheus, Sentry, Golang, Postgresql, Mysql and some other tools that i forgot to write here,

Thank you so much hope we can talk more (i prefer talking in linkedin or by email) Cheers
